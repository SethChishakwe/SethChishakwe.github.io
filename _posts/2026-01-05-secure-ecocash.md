## 🔒 Why EcoCash Security Matters in Zimbabwe

With over 11 million users and handling billions in transactions monthly, EcoCash isn't just a convenience—it's a critical part of Zimbabwe's financial infrastructure. Unfortunately, this popularity makes it a prime target for cybercriminals. Protecting your mobile money isn't just about securing funds; it's about safeguarding your entire financial identity in the digital age.

## 🚨 The Reality: Common EcoCash Scams in Zimbabwe

Before we get to solutions, let's understand what we're up against:

1. **Phishing SMS/WhatsApp:** "Your EcoCash wallet is suspended. Send PIN to restore."
2. **Fake Customer Care:** Callers pretending to be from Econet asking for your PIN.
3. **SIM Swap Fraud:** Criminals getting a duplicate SIM to access your EcoCash.
4. **Shoulder Surfing:** People watching you enter your PIN at POS terminals.

## 🛡️ 3 Immediate Actions You Can Take TODAY

### 1. Create a STRONG, UNIQUE EcoCash PIN
**The Problem:** Research shows 30% of Zimbabweans use their phone unlock PIN for everything.

**The Solution:**
❌ DON'T USE:
1234 or 0000
Your birth year (1999, 2000)
Repeated digits (1111, 2222)
Phone unlock PIN

✅ DO THIS:
Create a random 5-6 digit number
Mix it up: e.g., 48263 (not a pattern)
Change it every 3 months
Never write it down with your phone


**Pro Tip:** Use a "PIN sentence" method. Example: "My son Tawanda was born in 2020" = Mstwbi2020 = numbers from that = 420 (then add random digits).

### 2. NEVER Share Your PIN via SMS, Call, or WhatsApp
**The Scam Pattern:**
📱 SMS Example:
"Dear Customer, your EcoCash wallet has temporary restrictions.
Reply with PIN for verification. From: E-CONET Support"

📞 Call Example:
"Hello, I'm from Econet technical department. We're upgrading systems
and need your PIN to secure your account."

**How to Respond:**
- **LEGITIMATE COMPANIES NEVER ASK FOR YOUR PIN**
- Hang up immediately
- Save the number and report to Econet (111)
- Forward scam SMS to Econet's fraud department
- If concerned, visit an OFFICIAL Econet shop (don't call back!)

### 3. Enable ALL Security Features
**Most people only use basic EcoCash. Turn these ON:**

| Feature | How to Enable | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Transaction Alerts** | Settings → Notifications → ALL Alerts | Know immediately if unauthorized transaction occurs |
| **Daily Limit** | Set limit to your average daily spend | Limits damage if compromised |
| **Withdrawal PIN** | Different from main PIN for cash-out | Extra layer at POS/agents |
| **Biometric** | If phone supports fingerprint/face ID | Prevents unauthorized app access |

**To enable these:**
1. Dial `*150#`
2. Go to "My EcoCash" → "Settings"
3. Enable everything in "Security Settings"

## 📱 Real Zimbabwean Case Study

**Scenario:** Fiona from Harare received this WhatsApp:
> "Good morning customer. Your EcoCash line is due for KYC update. Please send your PIN and ID number for verification. Reply STOP to opt out."

**Red Flags Fiona spotted:**
1. Urgent language ("due for update")
2. Requests PIN via WhatsApp (Econet never does this)
3. Poor grammar ("line is due")
4. No official Econet logo or verified badge

**What Fiona did RIGHT:**
1. Screenshotted the message
2. Did NOT reply
3. Reported to Econet via 111
4. Shared warning in family WhatsApp group

## 🎯 Your 5-Minute EcoCash Security Check

Take action RIGHT NOW:
- [ ] Change your PIN if it's weak or shared with other services
- [ ] Enable transaction notifications
- [ ] Set a daily transaction limit
- [ ] Save Econet fraud number: 111
- [ ] Educate one family member about these scams

## 💬 Shona Translation (Kuchengetedza EcoCash Yako)

**Matanho ari nyore:**
