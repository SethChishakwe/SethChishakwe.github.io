## 🔒 Why EcoCash Security Matters in Zimbabwe

With over 11 million users and handling billions in transactions monthly, EcoCash isn't just a convenience—it's a critical part of Zimbabwe's financial infrastructure. Unfortunately, this popularity makes it a prime target for cybercriminals. Protecting your mobile money isn't just about securing funds; it's about safeguarding your entire financial identity in the digital age.

## 🚨 The Reality: Common EcoCash Scams in Zimbabwe

Before we get to solutions, let's understand what we're up against:

1. **Phishing SMS/WhatsApp:** "Your EcoCash wallet is suspended. Send PIN to restore."
2. **Fake Customer Care:** Callers pretending to be from Econet asking for your PIN.
3. **SIM Swap Fraud:** Criminals getting a duplicate SIM to access your EcoCash.
4. **Shoulder Surfing:** People watching you enter your PIN at POS terminals.

## 🛡️ 3 Immediate Actions You Can Take TODAY

### 1. Create a STRONG, UNIQUE EcoCash PIN
**The Problem:** Research shows 30% of Zimbabweans use their phone unlock PIN for everything.

**The Solution:**
```plaintext
❌ DON'T USE:
- 1234 or 0000
- Your birth year (1999, 2000)
- Repeated digits (1111, 2222)
- Phone unlock PIN

✅ DO THIS:
- Create a random 5-6 digit number
- Mix it up: e.g., 48263 (not a pattern)
- Change it every 3 months
- Never write it down with your phone
