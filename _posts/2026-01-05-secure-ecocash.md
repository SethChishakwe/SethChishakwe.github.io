## Why EcoCash Security Matters

With over 11 million users in Zimbabwe, EcoCash has become essential for daily transactions. But this popularity makes it a target for cybercriminals. Protecting your mobile money protects your financial life.

## 3 Immediate Actions to Take

### 1. Create a Strong, Unique PIN

**The Problem:** Many people use simple PINs like 1234 or their birth year.

**The Solution:**
- Create a random 5-6 digit number
- Don't use patterns (1111, 1234, 0000)
- Never use your phone unlock PIN
- Change it every 3 months

### 2. Never Share Your PIN

**Common Scams:**
- SMS: "Your EcoCash is suspended. Send PIN to restore."
- Call: "I'm from Econet support, need your PIN to fix issues."

**Remember:** Legitimate companies NEVER ask for your PIN.

### 3. Enable Security Features

Turn these ON in EcoCash:
- Transaction notifications (get alerts for all transactions)
- Daily spending limits
- Withdrawal PIN (different from main PIN)

**How to enable:** Dial *150# → My EcoCash → Settings → Security

## Real Zimbabwean Example

**Scam SMS:** "Dear customer, your wallet needs verification. Reply with PIN. From: E-CONET"

**Red flags:**
- Urgent language
- Requests PIN via SMS
- Misspelled sender (E-CONET not Econet)

**What to do:** Delete the message. Do NOT reply.

## Your 5-Minute Security Check

- [ ] Change your PIN if it's weak
- [ ] Enable transaction notifications
- [ ] Set a daily limit
- [ ] Save Econet's fraud number: 111
- [ ] Educate one family member

## Shona Translation

**Zvakakosha:** Usambofa wakapa PIN yako kune chero munhu. Econet haikumbiri PIN yako nerunhare kana SMS.

**Matanho:**
1. Shandisa PIN yakasimba
2. Gonesa ziviso dzekutenga
3. Isa muganho wezuva nezuva
