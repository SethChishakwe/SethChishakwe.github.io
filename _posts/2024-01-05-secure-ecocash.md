## Protect Your EcoCash Today

EcoCash security matters for every Zimbabwean. Here are 3 simple steps:

### 1. Create a Strong PIN
Don't use 1234 or your birth year. Create a random 5-digit number.

### 2. Never Share Your PIN
Econet will NEVER ask for your PIN via SMS or call.

### 3. Enable Notifications
Turn on transaction alerts in EcoCash settings.
